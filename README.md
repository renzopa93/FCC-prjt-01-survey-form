# Survey Form – FreeCodeCamp Project

This is my very first project from the **Responsive Web Design** certification at FreeCodeCamp.  
I wanted to create a clean, simple, and responsive survey form using **only HTML and CSS**.  

## Features
- Semantic HTML structure for accessibility.
- Custom styling using pure CSS.
- Built-in validation using HTML5 attributes (no extra JavaScript).

## Live Demo

## What I Learned
This project was a great starting point. I learned:
- How to properly use `<fieldset>`, `<label>`, and `<input>` elements.
- How to implement client-side form validation using HTML5 attributes and CSS styling.

## Personal Note
As my **first ever project**, this was where I got comfortable writing raw HTML and CSS from scratch.  
It’s simple, but I’m proud of it, and it motivated me to keep learning and building.
